# Face frontalization

Face frontalization refers to the generation of synthetic frontal images of people's faces given their unconstrained photos. Here we provide a Pytorch implementation of a face frontalization GAN (generative adversarial network) model that uses Nvidia's DALI library for loading and pre-processing of the training data.
